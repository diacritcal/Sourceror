%%%   We focus on automated programming for several reasons: deep neural networks have recently demonstrated progress on automated code synthesis and program repair by leveraging existing technologies; computers and, in particular, modern integrated development environments present a rich alternative to the dominant simulation environments; programming is challenging for humans and machines alike and we foresee opportunities to increase the productivity of software engineers. That said, in this section we emphasize basic tools that enable the assistant to encode, represent and manipulate fully differentiable programs.
