%%%   Neuroscience offers a rich source of ideas relating to human cognition. The challenge for researchers working in machine learning and artificial intelligence is to translate those ideas into useful technologies. Increasingly, the technologies these researchers are developing are playing an important role in accelerating neuroscience by providing useful tools and models. There are significant opportunities for much closer cooperation between the different fields, but they require effort on both sides. The next section offers a sample of ideas drawn from neuroscience that are influencing our work.

%%%  This paper describes the focus, content and products of an advanced class in computational neuroscience at Stanford University. The focus is on the intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The content varies but for the last two years has emphasized cognitive architectures for digital agents like the programmer's apprentice. The products of the class are ideas, contacts and aspirations: ideas at the bleeding edge of neuroscience and artificial inteligence and the context in which to understand and apply them; contacts with scientists from around the world who talk about their work and lead discussions about what's new and next; and asprations to build the next generation of tools and technologies leveraging ideas from neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

From the brain of an Etruscan shrew weighing in at less than a tenth of a gram to a sperm whale brain weighing more than eight kilograms, it is clear that natural selection has stumbled on a basic brain plan and set of developmental strategies that enables it to construct a diverse set of special-purpose brain architectures for efficiently expressing a wide range of sophisticated behavior~\cite{DouglasandMartinCURRENT-BIOLOGY-12,WillemetBRAIN-SCIENCE-12}. The human brain with its approximately 100 billion neurons and the shrew brain with approximately 1 million neurons share the same basic architecture.

The mouse brain has homologues of most human subcortical nuclei and has contributed significantly to our understanding of the human brain and human neurodegenerative disease in particular. The differences between between human and chimpanzee brains are subtle~\cite{Mora-BermudezetalELIFE-16} and yet humans display a much wider range of behavior and express a much larger repertoire of genes than any other species~\cite{HawrylyczetalNATURE-NEUROSCIENCE-15}. So what makes the difference?

It's the connections between neurons that matter or, more generally, it's the different types of communication between neurons that biologists refer to as {\it{pathways}}. There are electrical, chemical and genetic pathways and each of them obey different constraints and are used for different purposes. They include point-to-point and broadcast methods of communication~\cite{HanetalNATURE-18}. They transfer information at different speeds and using different coding strategies. Layered architectures are common not just in the cortex but throughout the brain. It's the wiring that sets humans apart.

Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Human_Brain_Neocortex_Function}{\ref{fig_necortex}}} shows the major functional areas of the human neocortex including the primary and secondary sensory and motor areas. The proximal locations of the areas provide a very rough idea of how different functions might relate to another. The graphic shown belies the fact that the brain is three dimensional and much of its functional circuitry hidden under the cortical sheet. The human cerebral cortex is complexly folded to fit within the skull with much of it hidden within the folds. This folded sheet of tissue accounts for more than 75\% of the human brain by volume~\cite{SwansonTiN-95} and is largely responsible for the rich behavioral repertoire that humans exhibit. It is worth pointing out in this context that the cortical sheet enshrouds a collection of evolutionarily preserved and highly specialized circuits homologues of which are found in all mammals and without which the cortex would be useless.

The graphic shown in Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Human_Brain_Neocortex_Function}{\ref{fig_necortex}}} is a simplification of the standard medical textbook diagram. In particular, several of the association areas are not shown and those that are shown are labeled somewhat differently than is common practice. The organizing biological principle is that, the further away from the primary sensory areas, associative functions become more general by integrating information from multiple modalities to construct abstract representations tailored to serve ecologically relevant objectives~\cite{Higher_Cortical_Functions_Association}. It is worth contemplating the arrangement of areas to note that they converge on locations in the cortex that will play an important role in decision making and higher-order cognition more generally.

Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Human_Brain_Atlas_Allen_Institute}{\ref{fig_brains}}} highlights the 3-D structure of several subcortical nuclei emphasized in this paper showing how they relate anatomically to one another and to the cortex. The reconstructions were generated from data generated by {\it{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) of adult human subjects~\cite{HawrylyczetalNATURE-12} and offer additional functional insight complementing conventional histological studies~\cite{BridgeandClarePTRS-B-06}. They don't however provide detailed information concerning either local or long-range connectivity.

Traditionally, tracing connections between individual neurons has been accomplished using a variety of techniques including conventional histological and staining techniques, electrophysiology, neurotropic retroviruses and transgenic organisms expressing fluorescent proteins. However, these methods yield relatively sparse reconstructions and don't scale well to large tissue samples~\cite{Arenkiel2014neural,CallawayCURRENT-OPINION-08}.

Small samples of neural tissue can be fixed, stained and sliced into thin sections. Each of the sections is then scanned with an electron microscope and the resulting digital images analyzed with computer vision software to reconstruct neurons and identify synapses~\cite{MikulaandDenkNATURE-METHODS-15}. The process is time consuming but can be fully automated and scaled to handle larger samples~\cite{JanuszewskietalNATURE-METHODS-18,ZhengetalCELL-18}. 

It is also possible to reconstruct the major {\it{white matter tracts}} formed by bundles of myelinated fibers using diffusion-weighted fMRI and averaging over multiple subjects after registering the individual brain scans with a reference atlas~\cite{OishietalNEUROIMAGE-08,WakanaetalRADIOLOGY-04}. Unlike the previous technologies, this method is not destructive so it can be applied to human subjects and accuracy is improved by averaging over multiple subjects after registering the individual brain scans with a reference atlas

These major tracts increase the speed of signal transmission between regions allowing for more distant communication in larger brains. The differences between the neocortex in humans and chimpanzees are subtle~\cite{Mora-BermudezetalELIFE-16}; however, white matter connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing~\cite{ArdeschetalPNAS-19,Gomez-RoblesetalPNAS-15}.

  \caption{White matter tracts corresponding to bundles of myelinated neurons speed the transmission of information between distant regions of the brain. The left panel ({\colorred{A}}) shows the connections between the prefrontal cortex and circuits in the parietal and temporal cortex that shape conscious awareness, guide attention and support short-term memory maintenance~\cite{ChicaetalBSF-18,Dehaene2014}. The parietal and temporal cortices are known for being home to {\it{association areas}} that integrate information from multiple sensory systems thereby creating rich representations necessary for abstract thinking. In humans, white matter tracts between the frontal cortex and the cerebellum {\emdash{}} shown in the right panel ({\colorred{B}}) {\emdash{}} facilitate higher-order cognitive function in addition to their role in supporting motor function in all mammals. For example, these connections are particularly important in the development of reading skills in children and adolescents~\cite{TravisetalHBM-15,KozioletalCEREBELLUM-14}.}

The cerebellum in mammals serves to shape motor activities selected in the basal ganglia by ensuring they are precisely timed and well-coordinated. Such activities are initiated by the basal ganglia with executive oversight from the prefrontal cortex. In humans, the cerebellum also supports cognitive functions such as those involved in reading~\cite{TravisetalHBM-15}. Figure~{\urlh{#fig_White_Matter_Tracts_Long_Distance}{\ref{fig_tracts}}} ({\colorred{B}}) shows the white matter tracts connecting the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex where such abstract cognitive functions originate. 

A white matter bundle called the {\it{arcuate fasciculus}} {\emdash{}} Figure~{\urlh{#fig_White_Matter_Tracts_Long_Distance}{\ref{fig_tracts}}} ({\colorred{A}}) {\emdash{}} provides reciprocal connections between the frontal cortex and association areas in the parietal and temporal lobes plays a key role in attention and the active maintenance of short-term working memory, including support for language processing in the left hemisphere and visuospatial processing in the right hemisphere~\cite{ChicaetalBSF-18}.

The human brain exhibits structure at many scales, the white matter tracts being but one example. A common pattern involves paths that connect multiple circuits that have their own internal components and connections. At a global scale, processing begins in primary sensory areas, propagates forward through dorsal regions integrating additional sources of information to produce composite representations that are processed in the frontal cortex before returning through ventral regions responsible for motivation and action selection.

\subsection{Reciprocity}

%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many of the connections within such paths are reciprocal allowing feedback to adjust behavior and improve prediction. Similar reflective and self-corrective patterns arise within subcortical regions including the hippocampal complex and basal ganglia, e.g., between the dentate gyrus and CA1 in the hippocampus and as layered networks inside individual subcomponents such as the mossy fiber network within the dentate gyrus. Each level solves different problems, offers general insights and provides hints about how one might realize such solutions in artificial systems.

%%% Advocates of the {\it{two-streams hypothesis}}~\cite{GoodaleandMilnerTiNS-92} contend that sensory processing \emdash{} in particular, seeing and hearing \emdash{} splits into two streams that account for different aspects of perception \emdash{} accounting for {\it{what}} you perceive, e.g., properties of an object, versus {\it{where}} you perceive, e.g., its relative location.

Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Brodmann_Basal_Ganglia_Hippocampus}{\ref{fig_broadman}}} describes how subcortical nuclei such as the hippocampal complex and basal ganglia interact with cortical regions. Such attributions provide insight on how to construct complex artificial neural architectures composed of simpler subnetworks ostensibly responsible for component functions including perception, action selection and episodic memory.

Here we consider two levels of granularity: the first is coarse grained relying on major anatomical divisions illustrated in Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Human_Brain_Neocortex_Function}{\ref{fig_necortex}}}. The second is somewhat finer grained and relies on areal divisions based on cytoarchitectural distinctions involving cell types, neural processes including dendrites and axons, and other histological characteristics.

The former generally employs Korbinian Brodmann's decomposition of the cortex into 52 {\urlh{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area}{areas}} published in 1909~\cite{Brodmann1909} and revised several times since then to take advantage of more modern staining and imaging technologies as well as improved methods for functional localization. In many cases, identifying the Brodmann area associated with the endpoint of a neural connection can tell us a good deal about the functional relationship between two brain regions.

The left side of Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Brodmann_Basal_Ganglia_Hippocampus}{\ref{fig_broadman}}} ({\colorred{A}}) highlights the reciprocal connections between two subnuclei of the basal ganglia, the {\it{putamen}} and {\it{caudate nucleus}}, and locations in prefrontal cortex responsible for influencing action selection by adjusting input to the basal ganglia and, by way of the thalamus, locations in the parietal and temporal cortex that provide information about the current state relevant to decision making. 

We can often improve functional descriptions if we localize to specific Brodmann areas. For example, the {\it{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) is located in the prefrontal cortex is a region of the frontal lobes involved in the cognitive process of decision-making. In humans it consists of {\it{Brodmann area 10, 11 and 47}}. It is defined as the part of the prefrontal cortex that receives projections from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and is thought to represent emotion and reward in decision making~\cite{BotvinickandAnANIPS-09}. The prefrontal cortex, consisting of Brodmann areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 44, 45, 46 and 47, includes the OFC but covers a wider range of functionality.

The right side of Figure~{\urlh{#fig_Brodmann_Basal_Ganglia_Hippocampus}{\ref{fig_broadman}}} ({\colorred{B}}) highlights reciprocal connections between cortical areas {\emdash{}} Brodmann areas 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 46 {\emdash{}} and the hippocampal complex via the adjacent {\it{perirhinal}} cortex (shown as blue connections) and the {\it{parahippocampal}} cortex (shown as red connections) that are involved in representing and recognizing objects and environmental scenes.

The anatomy of the brain and patterns of connectivity linking its major functional areas provide a structural account that derives from and informs function. However, functional analyses relating to human cognition require technologies that are able to record neural activity or its correlates aligned with relevant behavioral features. Non-human model systems often employed when invasive technology is required.

On the one hand, optogenetics, two-photon microscopy and conventional electrophysiology are able to record from and modify the electrical activity of tens to thousands of neurons at the resolution of a few microns. While this represents progress, the coverage is inadequate for many studies, and the methods are, for the most part, limited to non-human subjects due to the invasive nature of their practical application~\cite{DombeckandTankCSH-11,BoydenBIOLOGY-11,ZhangetalNATURE-10,YizharetalNEURON-11}.

Conversely, fMRI can used to study awake, behaving humans performing a wide range of cognitive tasks, but relies on signals that are at best indirectly related to neural activity as in the case of blood oxygen levels, and that are currently limited to spatial resolutions on the order of tens of millimeters and temporal resolutions on the order of hundreds of milliseconds~\cite{GoenseetalFiCN-16,GloverPMC-11,BuxtonetalNEUROIMAGING-04}.

Moreover, the electrical activity of individual neurons is but one marker for neural function. Other pathways including diffuse signaling by way of chemical neuromodulation and genetic activity and protein transport at the cellular level are becoming increasingly important as markers for behavior at multiple time scales~\cite{WangandWangFiP-19}. Despite these limitations, neuroscientists have made considerable progress by combining information from different model systems using multiple recording technologies.
